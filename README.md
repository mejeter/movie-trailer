# Fresh Tomatoes Movie Trailers

### Source code for a Movie Trailer website.
This program displays basic information for a list of movies, including: title, storyline, poster, and trailer.

This program utilizes:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Python

The `media.py` file defines the class Movie and its instance variables. The `entertainment.py` file creates the instances and stores them in an array. The `fresh_tomatoes.py` file creates an HTML page, and defines the `open_movies_page` function, which takes the array of instances from `entertainment.py` as its only argument. The `fresh_tomatoes.py` file also contains the stylization and end-user functionality for the program, which includes populating the tiles on page load, playing the trailer in a dialog box, and displaying the storyline upon hovering over the movie poster.
